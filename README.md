Playground for O2/TRD on CERN's SWAN service
============================================

Usage
-----

I have not tested this, but try something along these lines:
```
ssh lxplus
/eos/home-j/joeuser/SWAN_projects/
git clone https://github.com/tdietel/swan-o2-playground.git
```

Then log into https://swan.cern.ch and start a new instance with the environment script `/eos/user/t/tdietel/etc/swan/o2-nightly-20220124-1.sh`.

Feel free to create a PR to improve this README.
